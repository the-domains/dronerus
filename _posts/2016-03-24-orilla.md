**Gorilla!!!**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/89ce785f-24a0-428d-9ac6-0ebdba03602e.jpg)

On the surface, Gorilla!!! is some tape, stenciled paper, a pedestal, and a drawing. In the abstract, Gorilla!!! is an investigation into the evolutionary process of art and the mysterious nature of the artists' mind. Through the use of semiotics, the current geopolitical climate, and a large public platform; Gorilla!!! challenges the viewers' notions of what is art? why did they do this? who are these people? why am I here? why do I care? Gorilla!!! is comprised of two main elements; a series of images inspired by 1950's era propaganda posters, and a pedestal with a drawing of Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin. In a top hat.
