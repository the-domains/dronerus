What does your truth matter if it stands in our way?

The grass is always greener on the other side they say. The F-35 Lighting is a military aircraft born of the Joint Strike Fighter "competition" that will cost U.S. taxpayers an average of $137 million dollars per plane for a total program cost of anywhere between $1.1 and $1.5 TRILLION dollars. What could one trillion dollars buy you instead of 2400 military aircraft? Construct 5.5 million median priced single family homes. Cover the average salary for a year for 14.7 million teachers. Build 500,000 miles of brand new two lane undivided roadways. Pay off every single college loan held by anybody in the U.S. This piece turns a critical eye at our run-away defense spending and the Military Industrial Complex's strangle hold on our society. A lush lawn, in the shape of the F-35 will sit on the plaza at the foot of local government in Grand Rapids. Over the course of the event the grass will be allowed to whither and die.
